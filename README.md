# Blurp
A platform independent graphics API.

### Features
Blurp aims to be a graphics framework that abstracts away any platform dependent code. The aim is to create a clean API that simplifies the creation of a rendering pipeline with multiple draw passes. Blurp is modelled after the modern graphics API Direct3D12, and implemented in OpenGL.

### Personal documentation
All goals and requirements for this personal project as listed in [this](https://github.com/janie177/Blurp/blob/master/Personal%20Project.docx) file.

### Note
As you can see, the Blurp logo has four periodic table elements. This makes it better than projects that have only a single one.
