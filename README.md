# Blurp
A platform independent graphics rendering API.

### Features
Blurp aims to be a graphics framework that abstracts away any platform dependent code. The aim is to create a clean API that simplifies the creation of a rendering pipeline with multiple draw passes.

### Note
As you can see, the Blurp logo has four periodic table elements. This makes it better than projects that have only a single one.
